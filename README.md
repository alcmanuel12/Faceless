# 🌐 Faceless


Faceless is a project dedicated to exploring the stories of women writers who were forced to publish under male pseudonyms in order to have their voices heard.

📖 About the Project

Throughout history, countless women have hidden behind male names to publish their work. From novels and poetry to essays and journalism, these authors challenged societal norms but often at the cost of their own identity.

Faceless aims to:

- Highlight the lives and works of these women.

- Preserve their contributions to literature and culture.

- Provide an accessible resource for researchers, students, and curious readers.

- Connections between their hidden and real identities.
